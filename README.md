# Robot-Arm-for-Sorting-Mechanism-using-ROS-and-YOLOv4

This Project is to have a Robot Arm to do sorting mechanisms for things using darknet with addition of Digital Twins

Idea: Sorting socks by its color using robot arm from conveyor system
Software Tool:
- YOLOv4 Neural Networks model - Prediction of socks color 
- ROS (Robotics Operating System) - Controlling robot arm and other apperatus
- MoveIt tool - For path planning and Kinematical definitions & Visualisation
